            "1. Kidney transplantation is a procedure performed on patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESRD), and it involves transplanting a kidney from a deceased or living donor to a recipient. The procedure can be further categorized based on the genetic relationship between the donor and recipient. \n",
            "2. The process involves placing a patient on a waiting list after a thorough medical evaluation, and once a kidney is available, it is typically placed in the lower abdomen. The recipient's original kidneys are not usually removed unless medically necessary. \n",
            "3. Though kidney transplant recipients generally have a longer life expectancy and better quality of life compared to those on dialysis, they are required to take immunosuppressant medications for as long as the new kidney is working to prevent the body from rejecting the new organ. \n",
            "\n",
            "Recommendations:\n",
            "1. Given the nature and potential complications of a kidney transplant, it's advisable that recipients undergo regular monitoring of the new kidney's function with tests such as measuring serum creatinine.\n",
            "2. As there is a longer waiting time for kidney transplantation, development of comprehensive policies to increase the number of organ donations can be beneficial. For recipients susceptible to rejection, they should be timely evaluated with a kidney biopsy if such an event is suspected.\n"
